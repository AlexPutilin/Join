            <p> Welcome to the help page for <a class="join" href="board.html">Join</a> , your guide to using our kanban project
                management tool. Here, we'll
                provide an overview of what <a class="join" href="board.html">Join</a> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
            </p><br>

            <h2>What is Join?</h2><br>
            <p> <a class="join" href="board.html">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of
                dedicated students as part
                of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>

            <p> Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard," is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <a href="board.html">Join</a> leverages the
                principles of kanban to help users
                manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>

            <p> It is important to note that <a class="join" href="board.html">Join</a> is designed as an educational exercise and is
                not intended for extensive
                business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee
                consistent
                availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <a class="join"
                    href="board.html">Join</a>.</p><br>

            <h2>How to use it</h2><br>
            <p> Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <a class="join" href="board.html">Join</a>:</p><br>

            <h3>1. Exploring the Board</h3><br>
            <p> When you log in to <a class="join" href="board.html">Join</a>, you'll find a default board. This board represents
                your project and contains four
                default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", "Await feedback" and "Done".</p><br>

            <h3>2. Creating Contacts</h3><br>
            <p> In <a class="join" href="board.html">Join</a>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the
                "Contacts" section, click on "New
                contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and
                they
                can interact with the tasks on the board.</p><br>

            <h3>3. Adding Cards</h3><br>
            <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click
                the
                "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like
                task
                name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p><br>

            <h3>4. Moving Cards</h3><br>
            <p> As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping
                the
                card from one list to another.</p><br>

            <h3>5. Deleting Cards</h3><br>
            <p> Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will
                permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
                irreversible.</p>

            <p> Remember that using <a class="join" href="board.html">Join</a> effectively requires consistent updates from you and
                your team to ensure the board
                reflects the current state of your project.</p>
